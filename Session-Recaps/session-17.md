## Notes

### Recap

Explored Argynvost, retrieved amulet of raven kind

Found the bones of dragon with missing skull, we think we should try to find it in Strahd's castle. We have a few clues

Sir Godfrey Gwilyn, shares info, insists on joining us in our quest(s)?

Combat with the other revnants around the table is incoming! 

### Beginning Tasks

Roll initiative against the other revenants

### Adventure Notes

Vladamir Hornguard yelling from throne room, and gets up and picks up his sword
The spirits start to move away from us

Remember: Sir Godfrey and Lord Vladamir are lovers

Last revenant, spirit leaves body, and gets sucked into Vladamir

Balinok Mountains

My bones will be scattered among my enemies, and not in their rightful place.

Beacon lights up from the painting, spectral dragon, sinks into painting, now seen in the painting flying , the glow fades

place of ill omen, confirmed in strahd's castle. 

So it's around 9pm now. Plan

- Krezek first
- Long rest
- Return dress
- Get abott handled
- Then to krezek
- Then to wherever we want

Time check: 1:30am, trying to enter krezk with our Sir Godfrey, convincing guards

Take a 2 day rest!

4 hours downtime playing cards

Long rest: 1700 hours (6 hour rest) 5pm

We return to the Abbey, with the dress. climbing road, snow dust, etc.

Vasilka (the golem) is learning to write. SO they can be taught?

Deal:

3 revivifies
3 large diamonds
Sets down on the floor
Elluin retrieves them, grabs dress, hands to Vasilka to change into the dress
3 300gp diamonds
Cleared of a curse is the other part

Antillian is cured of the curse. Lose swim speed, webbed feet, and gills. But no longer have disadvantage on con saves.

1d4+1hp basic healing salve, Dahlia knows this, uses basic ingredients, can be used in downtime (short rest or long rest)

### Ending Tasks

Level up to 7!

Feast at burgermeister with group?
Vistani recipes served

Spend 16 hours of downtime

- 8 hours helping with leather mending
- 4 hours at library?
- 4 hours cooking with Elluin

Food sources are based on the area in barovia
Krezk: Goats, chickens, cheese, low light vegetables
All of barovia has cows and grain of certain types
Pigs exist in vallaki
Sheep in barovia itself, but stored inside or underground because wolves
Root veggies, berries

+ Basic food gathering skills
+ Roll a different skill (survival/wis)
+ Only in barovia, Antilian gets a proficiency in survival when sourcing food sources (not cooking, just sourcing)

Group proposal, for OOC discussion on direction:

- Finish the long rest(s). 
- We now go to Baba Yasaga (sp?) and attempt to resolve that thread 
- We can keep an eye out for Ara Belle, but is low priority 
- We also low-priority schedule a visit to Vallaki only to give a chance for potion buying and maybe murdering an innocent toy maker (you monster)

TBD!
