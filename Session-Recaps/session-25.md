## Notes

### Recap

**Took last long rest ending at 2pm before arriving at amber temple**
**Took a short rest since, spent 2 hit dice. 6/8 left.**

Nightmares were of wolves chasing us with the Night Mother leading the path.

Temple made purely of amber
6am we can have another short rest?

### Beginning Tasks

Dead Mage in arrow slit room
Need to figure out what the lich's phalactery is, keep that in mind

### Adventure Notes

Found a secret room, contains spots for scrolls or maps
Xzayvian is turned into a rabbit, hijinks happen

Amber golem attacks
Was immune to physical and magic attacks
Asks to kill golem, and asks to find his former master's stuff

Bone box (box made out of bone), lich phalactery (info from the **Arcanloth** (is a demon) named (Ranas))

Lich is not what it used to be. Used to be powerful, now it is weak.
Something seems to have affected it's mind

We go back to the chapel, Antilian puts the rod against the door to lock us in

We explore further, and find a new room:

Amber glazed room. Floor of dark green marble. 3 sarcophogi, (N, E, S)
