## Notes

### Recap

Entered the argervolstolt (sp)
Knights had become revenants, leader wanted to stay that way

Asked us to free his people by lighting something, a beacon

Found Holy Symbol of Raven Kind
This is the "highest peak" card answer, Dhalia defers to letting Henson carry it

But there's no beacon!

### Beginning Tasks

Where is the beacon? Is it not a beacon?

### Adventure Notes

The ravens are not interactive, they are just watching us, but not hearing or being used as a familiar

We take a short rest, spend my last 3 hit die, get close to full (wholeness of body has already been used, and the drunk amulet, and the blessing of morning lord)

At dawn recharge:

- Drunk amulet
- Blessing of morning lord

We go down to the 2nd floor
The first floor looks partially flooded, we dont' know if the electricity is dispelled

We get sealed off in a hallway, and phantom warriors (6) attack
De defeated them, but had a hell of a fight. Nobody went down, but Antillian jumped out the window (got a kill) and suffered a lightning strike.

Found 4 potions of invulnerability, you take 1/2 damage for a minute (resistance to all damage)

Dahlia: Check in the rafters of strahds dragon chamber (cat spirit animal)
Henson: Raven lands on his arm, (check in the bed in strahds chamber)
Antilian: Bat! Seek a bloody spear at YesterHill

We found a spell book, took some time to read it
We enter the out house, Antilian took some blade damage from the door

Verse, draconic, on far wall

_Here lie the bones and treasures of_
_Argynvost, lord of Argynvostholt and  
_founder of the Order of the Silver Dragon._

Set of bones, shaped like a dragon, missing its skull! We gotta find the skull

We see someone looking out at us, from a tower window.
Floor? 3rd floor, north side we didn't clear out
5 more revenants, at a table

Sir Godfrey Gwilyn, shares info, insists on joining us in our quest(s)?

Combat with the others around the table is incoming! 

### Ending Tasks

Roll initiative against the other revenants!
