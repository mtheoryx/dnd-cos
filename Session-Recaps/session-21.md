### Adventure Notes

We figure that going to the source is more valuable, and we aren't in a position to long rest anyway (only like 5 hours into our day)

Approaching yesterhill:

Time: noon-ish

Dead grass, 50 foot tall statue, made of twigs, towering cloaked man with fangs, effigee of strahd

Ring of black boulders

Found blood spear, unattune the spider boots , they go to Jules

We found 1 of the gems, ed brought it to us after the explosion caused by finding it in the giant tree blight. Ed recognized Antillian.

### Ending Tasks

Take a long rest at winery
Promise that Fenric won't steal, fenric stays with Antilian
