### Beginning Tasks

- Done with Bluto
- Return to vallaki for the night, take off wherever we want to go
- We decide where we want to go next

### Adventure Notes

En route to vallaki, we will get there around 4pm or so. We have a  long rest available, but we don't have to use it.

We go to the arms dealer, looking for a bag of holding with party funds.

10 scrolls booklet. For cure wounds. We wanna take it. 500 gp, party paid 300, Xzayvian did 200, party has 30 left.

We decide to go back to Argonvystalt, the goal is to re-get the revenant, and what else?

A vistani on a draft horse, with a wagon, and a plain wooden coffin
"A gift for you" directed to Antilian, cursed, sucked me into it, "Xzavian saved me"

Trapped door, cone of cold

Cabinet of treasures, a perfume, fenric spritzes, and we hear a howl in the distance. Enchantment magic.

Xzavian finds a wooden doll missing a hand and a foot, transmutation magic

Jules, something jar-shaped. Conopic jar, organ storage for ancient egyptians, lid sculpted in the head of a goat. The jar feels warm! Don't open until Xzavian inspects it. Has illusion magic on it.

Antilian, leather, soft, full of liquid. If you inter the wineskin with a dead man for a night, it will refill. Magical, with conjuration magic on it.

Jules opens the jar, it turns into crystal heart. Filed wiz saves get enthralled by the heart. Fenric has poked the heart. He took a 46 damage from doing so.

Jules must prove strength to him, in a fight. And does, hands over a sun blade.

**Break Time**

Level up! To 8

Jubilation emotion comes from the sword, Jules feels this. It's sentient!

Fenric contracted lycanthropy, and the curse was removed by Xzavian. but the cursed mark remains, back of one of his hands (left)

We got to the Yesterhill adventure, and get ambushed by a giant tree!

We kill the tree, Jules got that kill, and it was amazing!

And we find out what happens next week!
