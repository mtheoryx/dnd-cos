## Notes

### Beginning Tasks

Henson got a dark gift, Mist Walker
Said he saw Strahd, and tried to punch him!
Surrounded by the vampyre spawn we were fighting
Pray to your god, response from [[Lady of the Mist]]
Can travel the mists, mists can be locked, can't leave on your own, and can't stay in 1 spot for more than around 3 weeks

Dahlia got Jenny, has to bring 3 animals to a haag
[[Jenny Green Teeth]]

We are all at the Blue Water Inn, talking, sharing, and prepping.

### Adventure Notes

- Go recover Henson's sword at coffin maker

Elluin loans rapier/sword to Henson for now
We go back, recover the sword for henson, give Elluin back the sword
Attitude is totally changed, like he got a good talking-to from the priest after the crime was uncovered.
Additionally, the coffin maker gives us a pouch of coins (strahd marked coins)
	- 30s, 12 electrum
	- Henson wants nothing to do with the coins, bc the mark
	- Elluin will hold, and we'll spend these first before other coins

- Check in on the bones at st andrews, make sure things are kosher

We pitch in feeding the needy, helping them as required
Milivoj (grave digger) has an entirely changed mood now
Priest thanks us, brings us inside, grants the party:

- 1 free ressurect
- Room & board any time we require
- A hideout, it's a legit protected place now (hallowed)
- 10 platinum each

We ask about Baba, he only knows she's an evil witch. Dead end for now.

The festival:
- Feels like a necessity to please the Burgermeister
- The bones are keeping the town safe, but they go with the flow to placate

The dress:
- Burgermeister's wife had a similar dress
- Priest married her in that dress

Visit the Burgermeister's home

- We notice "malicious unhappiness" from the staff
- Paintings of the Vallakovich family, they look alike, up on the walls
- Burgermeister enters with 2 large mastiffs, and [[Izek Strazni]] a large, deformed bodyguard
- Lady Patrovna seeemed open to giving the dress, burgermeister wasnt
- Must attend festival first, and then "All will be well"

[[Izek Strazni]] in charge of finding 2 missing people

- 2 staff missing, parties sent out, nothing turned up
- Facial features similar to [[Ireena Kalyana]]
- Lost an arm in an attack, we think the current is a Dark Gift
- He's a soul-less sociopath, and doesn't want help finding the 2 missing, doesn't want to find them himself.

Level up to 5

Get silvered weapons for the party

We visit the Blacksmith, [[Victoria]] running [[Viictoria's Arms]]

- We meet a stronk woman
- It's gonna take a day to get some silvered weapons
- Antillian goes for a silvered spear, as well as 10 silvered darts

We meet [[Korena]], Victoria's daughter. She's trained in magic/arcane and can enchant stuff. Victoria delegates to her.

We visit the Toy Maker, [[Blenski's Toys]] run by [[Gladdof Blinsky]]

- Complains about Kritz von Wierg, Castle of Ravenloft
- Never pays, orders dolls of Ireena, demanding ever more perfection and accuracy
- Find nothing nefarious about the toy maker

We find a large brown cat for Dhalia, chase it all over town, get it back in the Rictavio's Carnival Wagon. [[Rictavio]] will meet us outside the city and travel with us to Jenny's

We attend the Festival of the Blazing Sun
- People in stocks, freeing is a crime
- We get on stage to say all will be well
- Burgermeister tries to light a 10" (or 10') wicker ball, it starts raining
- People lose thier shit
- I forget the rest
- We did a good job, and we got the dress. We hang onto it for now.

Post festival, [[Lady Wactor]] gives us a letter. It's a dinner invitation with Strahd.

Jenny Visit

We travel with Rictavio, and the 3 animals, to see Jenny. She smoosh them. Dhalia's curse/debt is lifted.

We travel back up to the fork in the road, and hop into the carriage to be taken to meet Strahd.
