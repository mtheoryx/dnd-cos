Explored, saved a wizard, amber golem, encountered an Arcanloth

### Beginning Tasks

- [x] Adjust stats from dark gift

- Hunt and kill lich

Exanter (Lich dot exe)

### Adventure Notes

Check out one of the arrow slit rooms
Golem was moved by Ranas
We move to the west wing of the amber temple
Encounter a gladiator, and locked up Ed
We defeat them, take a short rest, and attempt to free ed
Eldrich runes, active, magical, found on a bone inside Ed when he yacked it up
Secret door in room
Trap
Hit with dart, asleep for 4 hours
Took damage, but slowly healed up after dart sleep
Full HP on awake, no permanent damage

Learned that True Polymorph requires 1 hour duration after casting to make it permanenet. Until then, it works like regular polymorph where dropping the creature to 0 HP reverts them back to original form, with all prior HP, and transferring excess damage to original creature.

Found a book, wonderous item
Cover is a bearded man with a gem in his forehead
Doesn't require attunement
Gives over to Xzavian

Dining table, good food smells
See 7 spectres sitting at table


### Ending Tasks

Jules and Antilian are snapped out of our trance
We end the night, and choose to continue
