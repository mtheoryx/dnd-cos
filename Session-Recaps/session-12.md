## Notes

### Beginning Tasks

Traveling to meet Strahd, per dinner invitation

## Adventure Notes

If shit goes south, we meet back at the The Blue Water Inn in Vallaki

[OOC] Henson tried to pray to Torm, instead saw the face of the Misty Woman in the window of the carriage. We didn't see this. He didn't say.

The place is tall. Impossibly tall. Falling from even the first exposed floor above the first is unwise.

Big use of stone gargoyles on the outside, and throughout the interior.

50' wide fog-filled chasm, wooden drawbridge with noisy chains. Twin turret's.

The interior courtyards, and inside castle is richly lit with torches and sconces throughout.

[[Castle Courtyard]] We see a large round window with shards of glass in it's frame.

From the east, via the south archer's slit, a room just full of mirrors, many sizes, makes, and models.

Greeted by [[Rahadan]] who leads us to the dining room to be recieved by Strahd, currently just jamming away on the organ.

Directly across from the dining room is a spiral staircase that goes both UP and DOWN.

We dine with Strahd. Get a full run-down on history, with a Strahd-positive flavor spin, of course. New people arrive to the realm for Strahd's amusement.

LAST QUESTION, team torn between two:

1. Tell us about the Abbot
2. Who or what is the biggest thorn in your side?

Chose the latter. The answer from Strahd:

1. The Keepers of the Feather (we suspect ravens or something?)
2. YOU (that's us)

Strahd disappears, lights out, cool gust, doors slam shut, drawbridge goes up, and gate slams down. We're trapped.

The castle dive, fight, and escape attempt begins!

There is another staircase that goes down up and down that has been walled-off from going down accessible from the ravaged chapel.

We find [[Helga]]. She's a vampyre too. *(turned by Strahd?)* But also a captive and a servant. Daughter of bootmaker in barovia... 5 centuries ago.

She says Gertruda was last seen in the "King's Chambers".

She asks if she can escape with us.

We find out REAL quick, don't tempt fate running out via the big gates... 2 frickin red dragons (not dragons, but similar) guard leaving. We... quickly back out of that plan.

### Ending Tasks

We return back to where Helga is, abandoning the idea of sneakin out via the gates.
