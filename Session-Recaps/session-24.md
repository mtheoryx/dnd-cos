## Notes

### Recap

### Beginning Tasks

Facing an agressive goat, of some kind

### Adventure Notes

Goat sounds like thunder, it rears up and lightning strikes it, lightning wave!
We take dex saving throws for lighting damage
We roll initiative, goat fight
Goat charges, head but!
Antilian and Jules get hit
We decided to keep the goat, campfire, cook, attempt to smoke the meat, and also prep the skin
We take a short rest, eat some food, Xzayvian healed Antilian to max
we try to take a long rest, but fail, because nightmares
Now we have to sleep during the day
Some ROCKS appear, one of them gargantuan
2pm wake up finally
Find a corpse laying along the path
Barovian child, torn to pieces, we don't know what
Dire wolf bites, and strangely looks like Xzayvian when he was a child
Ravens follow us, swell in numbers. They aren't interested in a food offering, but they do swarm and kill a wolf in our path

Arrive at the amber temple

Extreme cold until we can keep ourselves warm, sub-zero temperature
Temple carved into the mountain. 6 alcoves. Statues
Staircase leading down
Flaming skulls, electric, fire, something else??
Ring of warmth to fenric, still needs to attune to it
Dead mage in arrow slit room
