### Adventure Notes

Discover a foot trail that cuts through the wilderness, looks like it's had foot traffic
3 hours in a loop, it is now 10am

We arrive, enter a new area! Ruins of Berez, the winderay told us we would likely find Baba Yasaga here

See a light coming from across the river, discover a woman standing in the fog

Near perfect circle of statues (menhier?) 12, moss covered, 15 to 18 feet, a few lean inward as if share a secrete

Peasant woman, dagger, rusty lantern [[Murial Vinshaw]], here on behalf of the marakov family (from the winery). She is watching baba yasaga, and she's a spy.

Berez abandonned after a flood, long ago. Baba lasaga moved hut here. She's not always in her hut. Sometimes flying around in a giant skull.

Watch out for scarecrows, they are dangerous. And they are always around the hut. The scarecrows are sent to attack the winery, periodically.

Trapped some mountain goats recently, does she eat them? Use them for a ritual?

Stories about the "Druids of yesterhill", they worship strahd as their newfound diety.

Druids still visit the standing stones (these stones). Also, Baba is a hagg.

This place is our conjurer (history, help understand enemies)!

Wooden hut built on top of the stump of a giant tree. A skull of a giant. Scores of ravens trapped in the ornaments. Flanking the hut's doorway

Giant iron bird cages sealed shut with magic.
