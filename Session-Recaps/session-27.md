## Notes

### Recap

Some stuff was broken with the rubble fall
Antilian and Jules got a spell on them
Xzayvian stopped the effect

### Beginning Tasks

### Adventure Notes

Stahds chamberlin, Rahadin, steps in the temple
Swallows a whole toad, supplucates to the statue
Rhanas didn't react, why?
We let him leave, should have taken them hostage for information

We ask, what god is that statue? Why did Rahadin do that?
We traded info about Strahd's treasure defenses, and then location
We learned
God of secrets

Been in this room and that's all he's done

Magic book under lich's bed, he doesn't know why

We should probably destroy the sarcophogi, the ember ones. Can destroy with weapons

West: Queen of poxes, spread disease, can cast contagion as an agion
South: Howling storm, cast lightning as an action
East: Soul hungerer, gift to raise recently deceased, raise dead

We attack, destroy and banish

Sholks, said and the door opens

Another set

North: The inscrutible, power to shield mind, mind blank spell, increased duration
East: Grave worm, flight power, grow wings and can fly at speed of 50 feet
South: Shame, amore, lady of delights, power of persuasion. Gives you suggestion spell, and saves have disadvantage

Child sized sarcophogus? *(remains of his daughter)*
Dresses and gowns? *(Wooden money included)*
Life size wooden poney? *(Try to find a way to ressurect her)*
