Fenric Kells

### Recap

### Beginning Tasks

Start with Antilian being reincarnated
Old man, pulling a cart, comes into Berez, 2 days after fight/death
House has been moved, we don't know where, no scarecrows
Finds 2 people, mangled bodies, 2 other depressions exist, but they disappeared
Has to choose between the 2 of us, one of us is in worse condition, in pieces
He chooses the one who died the worse death, Antilian
Old man picks up remains of Antilian's head, takes to cart. In the cart is a body that he had prepared!
Casts "Reincarnate" spell!

### Adventure Notes

A tug pulls at my naval, feels like a hook, but stops hurting, spirit being pulled away from vallaki to berez, I'm back
Say goodbyes to Henson

Decide to go to vallaki, the man offers to wagon me to where I want to go

Shift to rest of party...

It's been like 2 weeks since Antilian left. Previous history, discuss connections

Fenric was robbing, got pushishment to minimum
Antilian was saved from a siege from (Zavian)
Antilian pleaded case to Jules (boss) to let his cons slide, they sometimes do good, and they don't do harm
Fenric and Zavian are con men together

The 3 try to meet up at our agreed spot, Antilian isn't there
Hear of people disappearing
One man, "Wolves, been eaten, blown it off as nothing"
They backtrack to see where Antilian may have gone missing

Found a family, said last time they saw him he walked into a fog bank, then was gone
Bandits using the fog? Try searching that area...
Family has sick kid (measels), Zayvian heals, get hot meal

Find a lot of footprints, that don't complete their journey, they vanish. Continue searching around

They arrive in the Tser Pools (the cards), Ivlis River encampment

1 wagon, single tent (larger) remain here (there used to be horses and multiple wagons)

Vistani man, playing accordian by the fire, says go see Madam Eva (in the tent)

**Antilian existing fortune**
1 of stars, transmuter "Go to a place of dizzying heights, where the stone itself is alive"

**New fortunes for the 3**

Some are the same?

- King of hearts, Ghost: "I see a fallen paladin of a fallen order of knights. He lingers like a ghost in a dead dragon’s lair." He awaits Antilian where he died?
- Queen of Clubs, Mother: "Look to the mother’s tomb."

3 new cards:

- Xzayvian: 8 of stars, "A woman hangs above a roaring fire, find her and you will find the treasure"
- Julianna: 5 of swords, Myrmidon "Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night."
- Fenric Kells: 1 of swords, Avenger "This card tells of history, knowledge of ancient will help you better understand your enemy, the treasure lies in a dragon's house, hands once clean, now corrupted"

Antilian has the better map, with some locations documented
Group only has a crude map

Back to Antilian:

I recover in old man's home. But I volunteer at the church. A mysterious hunchback also voluneering. He'd probably ignore me, but I take a closer look at him, just to see anything.

I notice some familiar clothing, but can't make it out.

Retraining body via sparring and manual labor. I regain use of my monk stuff. Friends are on the way towards me.

Morning, 2 days later, group arrives, guards ask who you are...

Morning-ish, Day 1

We choose to go after ara belle as our first new group quest. She's to the north, toward the shore of Lake Zarovich

We see man in boat with fishing pole. We go out on a row boat. 30 feet (1.5 mph), same as walking speed.

He becomes angry, hucks a burlap sack overboard!

The group saves her, it's for sure Arabelle (one word), and she is pissed. We want to take her back to [[Luvash]] (her father)? (per Xzayvian)

Whe have to choose what to do with [[Bluto]], we don't trust him to follow us, he's had his mind altered and doesn't match reality, and we can't just leave him.

**Break time!**

What does the group chose to do? We carry this man, try to find out if he is actually guilty or not (magic alter, or not?)

10am timecheck

Vistani camp, we arrive!

9 Nine I (remember that)

Treasure, wagon 1:
    - 1,200 electrum, profile visage of strahd

    - Onyx jewelry box, 6 pieces of jewelry, and a potion of poison
    - Throne with gold and stones
    - 10 foot square rug
    - 12 potions in a box (don't take these, these are bad)
    
  We take:
      - Onyx jewelry box, 6 pieces of jewelry, and a potion of poison
      - Poisioner's kit can apply this to a weapon, or just dump it all all over
     - 250gp for the box
    
We stay there for the evening, no worries. 

Cast 2 3rd level spells (Xzayvian) to remove his memory thing

We mount up with the vistani to fight the cultists to the south of vallaki, Antilian is mounted with Bluto

We are now left alone facing a small group of cultists
